# ===== IMPORT SECTION =====
# Import necessary modules for web automation

from selenium import webdriver
# 'webdriver' is the main module that controls browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
# It's like a remote control for your browser

from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
# 'By' helps us find elements on a webpage using different methods
# Examples: By.ID, By.CLASS_NAME, By.LINK_TEXT, By.CSS_SELECTOR

from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
# 'WebDriverWait' makes the script wait for specific conditions before continuing
# This prevents errors when elements take time to load

from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
# 'expected_conditions' (EC) defines what conditions to wait for
# Examples: element_to_be_clickable, visibility_of_element_located

from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
# 'Service' helps manage the ChromeDriver (the bridge between Python and Chrome)
# It handles starting/stopping the driver process

from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
# 'ChromeDriverManager' automatically downloads and manages ChromeDriver versions
# No need to manually download ChromeDriver files

import time
# 'time' module provides sleep functionality to pause execution
# Useful for waiting when explicit waits aren't suitable

# ===== MAIN FUNCTION DEFINITION =====
def automate_product_search(product_name):
    """
    This function automates searching for a product on an e-commerce website
    Parameter: product_name - the name of the product to search for
    """
    
    # ===== BROWSER SETUP =====
    # Automatically download and setup ChromeDriver
    service = Service(ChromeDriverManager().install())
    # ChromeDriverManager().install() downloads the correct ChromeDriver version
    # Service() creates a service object to manage the driver
    
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service)
    # Creates a new Chrome browser instance using the service
    # This opens a new Chrome window that Python can control
    
    driver.maximize_window()
    # Makes the browser window full screen
    # Helps ensure all elements are visible and clickable
    
    # ===== MAIN AUTOMATION LOGIC =====
    try:
        # 'try' block contains the main automation code
        # If any error occurs, it will jump to the 'except' block
        
        print(f"Opening website...")
        # Print status message to console (f-string formatting)
        
        # Navigate to the demo e-commerce website
        driver.get("https://www.demoblaze.com/")
        # .get() method navigates to the specified URL
        # Like typing the URL in address bar and pressing Enter
        
        print(f"Searching for product: {product_name}")
        # Print which product we're looking for
        
        # ===== WAIT AND CLICK CATEGORY =====
        # Wait for page to load and click on 'Laptops' category
        laptops_category = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.LINK_TEXT, "Laptops"))
        )
        # WebDriverWait(driver, 10) = Wait up to 10 seconds
        # .until() = Keep waiting until the condition is met
        # EC.element_to_be_clickable() = Wait until element can be clicked
        # (By.LINK_TEXT, "Laptops") = Find element with exact text "Laptops"
        
        laptops_category.click()
        # Click on the found "Laptops" link
        # This navigates to the laptops section
        
        # ===== WAIT FOR PRODUCTS TO LOAD =====
        # Wait a moment for products to load
        time.sleep(2)
        # Simple 2-second pause to ensure products load
        # Sometimes needed when explicit waits aren't sufficient
        
        # ===== PRODUCT SEARCH LOGIC =====
        # Try to find and click on the desired product
        try:
            # Inner try-except block for product-specific operations
            
            product_link = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
                EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.LINK_TEXT, product_name))
            )
            # Wait for a clickable link with the exact product name
            # If product exists, this will find it; if not, it will timeout
            
            product_link.click()
            # Click on the product link to go to product details page

            # Extract product information from the product page
            product_title = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
                EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, "h2.name"))
            ).text
